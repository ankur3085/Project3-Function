# Simple Banking Smart Contract

This project implements a basic banking smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to deposit and withdraw Ether, check their balances, reset balances by the owner, and close the bank contract.

## Description

The `Banking` smart contract provides the following functionalities:

- **Deposit**: Allows users to deposit Ether into their account.
- **Withdraw**: Enables users to withdraw Ether from their account, provided they have sufficient balance.
- **Check Balance**: Users can view their current Ether balance.
- **Reset Balance**: The contract owner can reset any user's balance to zero.
- **Close Bank**: Allows the owner to close the bank contract, provided it has no remaining Ether balance.
